_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

- SmartWallet
  - Crosschain replay via executeWithoutChainIdValidation relies on gas values from one chain being valid and accepted by a bundler on other chains. This may not be the case.
- WebAuthnSol
  - Read comments on `WebAuthn.sol` for details on validation steps we are knowingly skipping
- FreshCryptoLib
  - Exploits should only be considered in the context of a call path starting with `ecdsa_verify`. Other functions are not intended to be called directly.
- MagicSpend
  - When acting as a paymaster, EntryPoint will debit MagicSpend slightly more than actualGasCost, meaning what is withheld on a gas-paying withdraw will not cover 100% of MagicSpend's balance decrease in the EntryPoint.


# Overview

This audit covers four separate but related groups of code
- SmartWallet is a smart contract wallet. In addition to Ethereum address owners, it supports passkey owners and validates their signatures via WebAuthnSol. It supports multiple owners and allows for signing account-changing user operations such that they can be replayed across any EVM chain where the account has the same address. It is ERC-4337 compliant and can be used with paymasters such as MagicSpend. 
- WebAuthnSol is a library for verifying WebAuthn Authentication Assertions onchain. 
- FreshCryptoLib is an excerpt from [FreshCryptoLib](https://github.com/rdubois-crypto/FreshCryptoLib/tree/master/solidity), including the function `ecdsa_verify` and all code this function depends on. `ecdsa_verify` is used by WebAuthnSol onchains without the RIP-7212 verifier, and `FCL.n` is used to check for signature malleability. 
- MagicSpend is a contract that allows for signature-based withdraws. MagicSpend is a EntryPoint v0.6 compliant paymaster and also allows using withdraws to pay transaction gas, in this way.

  - `CoinbaseSmartWallet`: Should comply with account behavior defined in `ERC4337`
  - `MagicSpend`: Should comply with paymaster behavior defined in `ERC4337`

## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)
- SmartWallet
  - Can an attacker move funds from the account?
  - Can an attacker brick (make unusable) the account?
  - Can functions not in `canSkipChainIdValidation` be used via `executeWithoutChainIdValidation`?
- MagicSpend
  - Can an attacker withdraw using an invalid WithdrawRequest?
  - Can an attacker be credited more than WithdrawRequest.amount?
  - Are there any griefing attacks that could cause this paymaster to be banned by bundlers?
- WebAuthn
  - False positive or false negative in validation
    - Are there valid webauthn authentication assertions that do not pass our validation?
- FreshCryptoLib
  - False positive or false negative in validation


## Main invariants
- SmartWallet
  - Only current owners or EntryPoint can make calls that
    - Decrease account balance.
    - Add or remove owner.
    - Upgrade account.
  - Any current owner can add or remove any other owner.
- MagicSpend
  - Only owner can
    - Move funds from contract without a valid `WithdrawRequest`.
    - Stake and unstake in EntryPoint.
    - Add and withdraw from EntryPoint balance.
  - Every `WithdrawRequest` can only be used once.
  - A `WithdrawRequest` cannot be used past `WithdrawRequest.expiry`.
  - Withdrawers can never receive more than `WithdrawRequest.amount`.
  - Withdrawers using paymaster functionality should receive exactly `WithdrawRequest.amount - postOp_actualGasCost`.
- WebAuthn
  - Validation passes if and only if
    - `'"challenge":""<challenge>"` occurs in `clientDataJSON` starting at `challengeIndex`.
    - `'"type":"webauth.get"` is occurs in `clientDataJSON` starting at `typeIndex`.
    - User presence bit is set.
    - User verified bit is set, if required.
    - `r` and `s` are valid signature values for `x`, `y` on the message hash that results from `clientDataJSON` and `authenticatorData`.
- FreshCryptoLib
  - All calls with valid sets of message, r, s, Qx, and Qy for the secp256r1 curve should return true.
  - All calls with invalid sets of message, r, s, Qx, and Qy for the secp256r1 curve should revert or return false.
