👋 Hello and welcome to the audit channel for the $49,000 **Smart Wallet** audit!

📆 Audit opens 03/14/2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) and runs through 03/21/2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) (7 days).

ℹ️ **New approach to warden questions:** For this audit, we’re piloting a new Q&A process. Please help us test it out!

1. **Create a private (or public) thread asking your question** and tag in @RaymondFam, who will be helping wardens with questions throughout the audit. @RaymondFam will review warden questions daily, and reply to either: a) validate the documentation bot's answer, b) provide additional clarification, or c) escalate your question to the sponsor team.
2. 🤖 **Documentation bot assistance:** While waiting for a response from the Lookout, you will have an option to get an answer from our documentation bot. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.  You can also tag `@Documentation Wolf` in any thread (private or public) to get answers directly from the bot.
3. :code4rena: **C4 staff will monitor all question threads,** so if you have any questions or concerns about this process, you can ask those in-thread too. 

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

@🐺wardens - a known issue was shared by the sponsor <5 minutes after the start time and has now been added to the README. This issue will be considered out of scope for the audit except for the bot race, since that has already run.

[03/17/2024 17:51] ivanfitro
yes


[03/17/2024 17:52] ivanfitro
but i see now that in the folder forge-std is empty


[03/17/2024 17:53] _3doc_
try with "forge install" then maybe


[03/17/2024 17:53] ivanfitro
ok i try


[03/17/2024 17:54] ivanfitro
now is working! I dont know why in forge-std is empty but now is full


[03/17/2024 17:54] ivanfitro
thanks!


[03/17/2024 18:14] ivanfitro
why in the constructor of CoinbaseSmartWallet is initialized the owners with the address(0)?


[03/17/2024 18:34] sp1cymeatball
To prevent implementation contract initialization


[03/17/2024 18:39] ivanfitro
ok thank you!


[03/18/2024 04:34] 0xabhay.
for every specific domain the webAuthn.sol generates a different private-public key pair?

[03/19/2024 11:28] 0xabhay.
Magicspend.sol is only funded by the User?


[03/19/2024 22:09] tamayonft
Same question, I think not, because the purpose of the paymasters is to pay for transactions on behalf of the user


[03/20/2024 00:07] shealtielanz
using the entry point, the user ops specifies the paymaster as the magic spender


[03/20/2024 00:10] shealtielanz
no mainly funded by the owner via `entryPointDeposit()` where the entry point uses the deposited funds as gas to run the user transactions


[03/20/2024 00:13] shealtielanz
user has funds in the magicspender in a scenario where the withdrawAmount is greater than the maxCost

[03/20/2024 11:48] 0xabhay.
every user deploys there own MagicSpend.sol?


[03/20/2024 15:21] sovaslava9
If user choose, that gas will be payed by his coinbase wallet, how will the funds appear on the magicspend contract? Coinbase website just hold funds on user balance and give signature..


[03/20/2024 17:52] 0xf40
No, the MagicSpend is an ERC-4337 Paymaster contact. It should be managed by Coinbase and provide services such as fee payment for users.


[03/20/2024 17:53] 0xabhay.
So it's like a sponsor paymaster


[03/20/2024 17:55] 0xf40
If gas will be payed by his wallet, there won't be a need for MagicSpend and User Operation probaly won't even contain paymaster(MagicSpend) data


[03/20/2024 17:55] 0xf40
I think so


[03/20/2024 17:56] 0xf40
```There are three different ways the Magic Spend smart contract can be used
1. Pay gas only
2. Transfer funds during execution only
3. Pay gas and transfer funds during execution
```


[03/20/2024 17:56] 0xabhay.
Yes boy thanks 🙏 i understand 👍

Understanding ERC-4337 may be tricky but we are here to help 🤓

In this post we focused on security pitfalls from a perspective of a smart wallet, here are some tips for you 🧵👇🏼

Users can transfer funds to Magic spend.sol?


[03/21/2024 06:55] shealtielanz
Not really 
It is managed and funded by coinbase. Only one MagicSpend on each chain


[03/21/2024 06:55] 0xabhay.
@shealtielanz a user coin base account?


[03/21/2024 06:56] shealtielanz
Yes, 
But not directly.
Take a request from coinbase app and your coinbase acct Is deducted, use that request to withdraw from MagicSpend.sol


[03/21/2024 06:57] shealtielanz
This can happen during the execution of the users operation in SCW `call()`


[03/21/2024 06:58] shealtielanz
Initially the withdrawal request is part of the payment master data in the user ops struct


[03/21/2024 06:59] 0xabhay.
so magic spend will spend my balance for the operations + gas ?


[03/21/2024 07:00] shealtielanz
The read me does a nice job to tackle the flow of user Tx


[03/21/2024 07:00] shealtielanz
Yes something very similar and any excess funds left is refunded to the users SCW acct


[03/21/2024 07:02] 0xabhay.
lol, I thought the protocol would pay the gas for the transaction. thanks for clarification

[03/21/2024 07:02] shealtielanz
Haa 😂 you pay first with your coinbase account


[03/21/2024 07:03] shealtielanz
It’s like made easy for the users


[03/21/2024 07:03] 0xabhay.
so it is a so-called AA


[03/21/2024 07:04] shealtielanz
the whole concept is AA, everyone in the system, like bundlers, entry point and the SCW with MagicSpend help Implement the Idea of the AA

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[03/21/2024 10:34] 0xabhay.
@shealtielanz SCW will hold the user assets, like ERC20 and ERC721?


[03/21/2024 10:36] shealtielanz
Yes i think that’s handled in receiver.sol

I am not talking about the one that is shared in the chat I am talking about the one on the C4 platform it has names of those who participated and had no validated findings.

[04/03/2024 09:14] .anas_22
Hi Joe I provided some really concerning vulnerabilities in that project like the  it allows the wallet to have no owner? Are my reports not validated or are there any problems in the C4 platforms because I did not receive any rejection mail.


[04/03/2024 09:20] kaveyjoe
There is no Any problem with c4 platform , c4 don't sent any confirmations mail for the submission that is  accepted or rejected.  u can check what happen to your submission when Report is published.


[04/03/2024 12:41] nilay27
I also submitted an issue along with the code and test showing a user being able to perform signature replay on a wallet and drain the funds via execution fee (in case there is no paymaster); it was rejected.
I look forward to the report to understand what I missed/misunderstood. 

This also means I need to push to get the backstage role so that, in the future, I can be a part of PJQA.


[04/03/2024 16:00] .anas_22
General question how many bug reports did you get in this competitive audit?


[04/03/2024 16:15] mctoady
There were around 200 issues submitted (probably ~50% gas/QA/analysis reports). Of which 3 HMs were found.
